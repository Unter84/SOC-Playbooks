# üî• FireEye Web MPS ‚Äì Overview & Example Alerts

## üìñ What is FireEye Web MPS?

The **FireEye Web Malware Protection System (Web MPS)** is a **network security appliance** that protects organizations from **web-based threats**.  

It sits inline (or out-of-band) in the network and inspects web traffic such as **HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP-over-HTTP**.  

### üõ°Ô∏è What it Detects
FireEye Web MPS identifies threats using **signatures, heuristics, and sandboxing (MVX engine)**. It focuses on:

1. **Malware & Exploits in Web Traffic**
   - Drive-by downloads (hidden malware on websites).
   - Browser/plugin exploits (Flash, Java, PDF, ActiveX, etc.).

2. **Command & Control (C&C) Communications**
   - Outbound beaconing to malware command servers.
   - Suspicious persistent connections from compromised hosts.

3. **Phishing & Exploit Kits**
   - Malicious redirects and fake login pages.
   - Exploit kit signatures (Angler, Nuclear, etc.).

4. **Known Vulnerability Exploits**
   - Detects exploit attempts mapped to CVEs (e.g., Cisco IOS IKE flaws).
   - Alerts on old and new scanning activity.

5. **Zero-Day Threats**
   - Uses sandbox detonation to analyze unknown files/traffic.
   - Flags behaviors that don‚Äôt match known safe activity.

üìä Response Workflow
	1.	Triage
	‚Ä¢	Validate if the event is a true positive.
	‚Ä¢	Cross-check with firewall/endpoint logs.
	2.	Contain
	‚Ä¢	Block source IP/domain.
	‚Ä¢	Isolate potentially compromised hosts.
	3.	Eradicate
	‚Ä¢	Patch vulnerabilities.
	‚Ä¢	Remove malware from affected endpoints.
	4.	Recover
	‚Ä¢	Restore systems from backups if needed.
	‚Ä¢	Monitor for repeat activity.
	5.	Lessons Learned
	‚Ä¢	Update detection rules & SIEM correlations.
	‚Ä¢	Add new Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to blocklists.
