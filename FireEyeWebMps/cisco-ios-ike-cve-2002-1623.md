# üõ°Ô∏è Playbook: Cisco IOS IKE Information Disclosure (CVE-2002-1623)

**Filename:** `playbook-cisco-ios-ike-cve-2002-1623.md`  
**Category:** Network / Vulnerability Exploitation Attempt  
**Use Case:** Investigating FireEye Web MPS alerts triggered by exploit attempts against Cisco IOS Internet Key Exchange (IKE) service (CVE-2002-1623).

---

## üéØ Alert Context ‚Äî Why this matters
- **Vulnerability:** CVE-2002-1623 (IKE information disclosure in Cisco IOS).  
- **Risk:** An attacker may query vulnerable Cisco IOS devices running IKE (UDP/500) and extract memory contents or cryptographic material.  
- **Impact:** Could leak sensitive information (session keys, memory data) and assist in VPN compromise or lateral attacks.  
- **Detection:** FireEye Web MPS flagged a packet matching this signature, meaning **someone attempted to exploit this flaw** against your perimeter.

**Relevant Logs/Sources:**
- FireEye Web MPS event logs  
- Firewall logs (Palo Alto, Cisco ASA, Fortinet, etc.)  
- Router logs (Cisco IOS/IOS-XE)  
- VPN/IKE service logs  
- IDS/IPS logs (Snort/Suricata, PAN Threat, Cisco Firepower)

## üß≠ Analyst Actions (L1 ‚Üí L2 ‚Üí L3)

### L1 ‚Äî Initial Triage
- ‚úÖ Note the **source IP, destination IP, port (UDP/500)**, and timestamp from the FireEye alert.  
- ‚úÖ Check whether the targeted IP corresponds to a **Cisco IOS device or VPN gateway**.  
- ‚úÖ Review whether the traffic was **allowed or blocked** at the firewall.  
- ‚úÖ Search for repeat hits from the same source IP.  
- üö© Escalate to L2 if:
  - Destination device is a production Cisco IOS router or VPN appliance.  
  - Multiple exploit attempts observed (brute-force scanning).  
  - Source IP belongs to hostile ASNs / known scanners.

L2 ‚Äî Deep Investigation & Correlation

1. Firewall Logs
	‚Ä¢	Review firewall events for UDP/500 traffic to the targeted IP at same timeframe.
	‚Ä¢	Was the connection blocked, allowed, or dropped?

index=firewall dest_port=500 proto=udp
| search dest_ip=<targeted_IP>
| stats count values(action) by src_ip dest_ip

2. Router / Device Logs
	‚Ä¢	If the destination is a Cisco IOS device:
	‚Ä¢	Review logs for IKE negotiation failures.
	‚Ä¢	Check for crash logs, CPU spikes, or unusual reboots.

3. IDS/IPS Events
	‚Ä¢	Look for corroborating alerts from other IDS sensors for UDP/500 anomalies.

index=ids dest_port=500 proto=udp
| search dest_ip=<targeted_IP>
| stats count by src_ip signature action

4. Threat Intel
	‚Ä¢	Enrich the source IP with VirusTotal/OTX/MISP.
	‚Ä¢	Identify if it belongs to a scanner (Shodan, Censys, masscan) or known attacker.

5. Lateral Correlation
	‚Ä¢	Check if same IP attempted other CVEs or scanning in your environment (multi-vector attack).

L3 ‚Äî Confirm & Respond

If Confirmed Exploit Attempt:
	‚Ä¢	üõë Contain
	‚Ä¢	Block offending IP at firewall.
	‚Ä¢	Geo-block if IP belongs to hostile ranges not used by business.
	‚Ä¢	üîé Eradicate
	‚Ä¢	Ensure IOS devices are patched (see Recommendations).
	‚Ä¢	Monitor targeted host for stability issues, crash logs.
	‚Ä¢	üîÅ Recover
	‚Ä¢	If router shows instability ‚Üí schedule reload and forensic review.
	‚Ä¢	Validate VPN/IKE services remain functional.

If False Positive:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Document as likely internet scanner noise.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Tune alerts to avoid unnecessary noise while keeping visibility.

üìù Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Template

1) Executive Summary
	‚Ä¢	What happened: FireEye MPS detected attempt to exploit Cisco IOS IKE (CVE-2002-1623).
	‚Ä¢	Impact: <Attempt blocked / Device targeted>
	‚Ä¢	Disposition: <True Positive exploit attempt | False Positive scanner noise>

2) Timeline
	‚Ä¢	T0: FireEye detection
	‚Ä¢	T1: Firewall log review (allowed/blocked)
	‚Ä¢	T2: Device log review (no impact observed)
	‚Ä¢	T3: Source IP enrichment (TI check)
	‚Ä¢	T4: Containment (IP block if malicious)

3) Root Cause
	‚Ä¢	[Internet scanner | Targeted exploit attempt]

4) Scope
	‚Ä¢	Destination systems targeted, any other IPs scanned

5) Actions Taken
	‚Ä¢	Containment, validation of device state, patch verification

6) Preventive Measures
	‚Ä¢	Patch IOS, restrict exposure, IDS/IPS signatures tuned

7) Lessons Learned
	‚Ä¢	Need to confirm all legacy IOS devices are hardened

‚∏ª

üõ° Recommendations
	‚Ä¢	Immediate Containment
	‚Ä¢	Block malicious source IPs.
	‚Ä¢	Enable IDS/IPS signatures for Cisco IOS IKE exploits.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure firewall restricts UDP/500 exposure only to legitimate VPN peers.
	‚Ä¢	Hardening
	‚Ä¢	Patch all Cisco IOS devices to versions that fix CVE-2002-1623 (2003 advisory).
	‚Ä¢	Disable IKE if not in use.
	‚Ä¢	Apply access control lists (ACLs) to restrict IKE to trusted peers only.
	‚Ä¢	Monitoring
	‚Ä¢	Continue monitoring FireEye and firewall for repeated UDP/500 probes.
	‚Ä¢	Correlate with other signatures to detect multi-CVE scanning.
	‚Ä¢	Process
	‚Ä¢	Document that many such alerts represent automated scanning noise, but always verify patch/hardening status.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure SOC team has inventory of exposed IKE endpoints.

‚∏ª

üìé Before Escalating to Customer

Provide:
	‚Ä¢	FireEye alert details (signature, timestamp, IPs, action).
	‚Ä¢	Firewall evidence (was traffic blocked or allowed).
	‚Ä¢	Device patch/hardening status.
	‚Ä¢	TI enrichment of source IP.
	‚Ä¢	Analyst recommendation (noise vs targeted attempt, patch status, blocking actions).
