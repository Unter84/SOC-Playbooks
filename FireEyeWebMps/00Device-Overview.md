# üî• FireEye Web MPS ‚Äì Overview & Example Alerts

## üìñ What is FireEye Web MPS?

The **FireEye Web Malware Protection System (Web MPS)** is a **network security appliance** that protects organizations from **web-based threats**.  

It sits inline (or out-of-band) in the network and inspects traffic such as **HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP-over-HTTP** to detect and stop attacks in real time.

### üõ°Ô∏è Key Capabilities
FireEye Web MPS provides multi-layered detection through **signatures, heuristics, and sandboxing (MVX engine)**. It focuses on:

1. **Malware & Exploits in Web Traffic**
   - Detects drive-by downloads.
   - Identifies browser and plugin exploits (Flash, Java, PDF, ActiveX).

2. **Command & Control (C&C) Communications**
   - Finds outbound beaconing attempts.
   - Detects persistent or suspicious communication to malicious servers.

3. **Phishing & Exploit Kits**
   - Detects malicious redirects and fake login pages.
   - Recognizes exploit kit traffic patterns.

4. **Known Vulnerability Exploits**
   - Matches exploit attempts against known CVEs.
   - Alerts on scans or attempts against outdated systems.

5. **Zero-Day Threats**
   - Executes suspicious files or traffic in a sandbox.
   - Detects abnormal behaviors even without signatures.

üõ°Ô∏è Example Event Types

1. Exploit Attempt
	‚Ä¢	Signature: Exploit against a known vulnerability.
	‚Ä¢	Details: Attacker probes a service or application for weaknesses.
	‚Ä¢	Risk: Depends on patching level; could be harmless scanning or serious threat.

‚∏ª

2. Malware Download

{
  "alert_id": "FW-EX-0002",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-07T13:20:04Z",
  "signature": "Drive-by Download ‚Äì Malicious JavaScript",
  "severity": "High",
  "source_ip": "198.51.100.23",
  "destination_ip": "10.0.0.22",
  "http_url": "http://example-bad-site.net/script.js",
  "action": "Blocked"
}

	‚Ä¢	Details: User attempted to download a malicious file.
	‚Ä¢	Risk: High ‚Äì could lead to endpoint compromise.
	‚Ä¢	Response: Block domain, scan the host, check proxy/firewall logs.

‚∏ª

3. Command & Control (C&C) Beacon

{
  "alert_id": "FW-EX-0003",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-07T14:45:12Z",
  "signature": "Outbound Beacon ‚Äì Known Botnet",

  "destination_ip": "203.0.113.99",
  "protocol": "HTTP",
  "http_url": "http://bad-c2-server.org/connect.php",
  "action": "Alerted"
}

	‚Ä¢	Details: Internal host contacted a known malicious command server.
	‚Ä¢	Risk: Critical ‚Äì strong indication of compromise.
	‚Ä¢	Response: Quarantine host, block destination, begin forensic analysis.

üìä Response Workflow
	1.	Triage
	‚Ä¢	Confirm alert validity (true positive vs false positive).
	‚Ä¢	Correlate with SIEM, firewall, and endpoint logs.
	2.	Contain
	‚Ä¢	Block malicious IPs, domains, or URLs.
	‚Ä¢	Isolate affected endpoints if required.
	3.	Eradicate
	‚Ä¢	Patch vulnerable systems.
	‚Ä¢	Remove malware from compromised hosts.
	4.	Recover
	‚Ä¢	Restore systems from backups if needed.
	‚Ä¢	Monitor network traffic for recurrence.
	5.	Lessons Learned
	‚Ä¢	Update SIEM correlation rules.
	‚Ä¢	Add new IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) to blocklists.
	‚Ä¢	Improve awareness of web-based threats.
