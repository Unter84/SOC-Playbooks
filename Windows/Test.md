üõ°Ô∏è Playbook: User Added to a Group (AD / Entra ID)

Use this whenever your SIEM/IDP raises an alert that a user (or service principal) was added to a local/domain/M365/Entra group.

‚∏ª

üéØ Alert Context ‚Äî Why this matters

Adding an account to a group can silently elevate privileges, grant new access paths, and enable persistence (e.g., adding a compromised account to Domain Admins, Local Administrators, Exchange Org Management, or high-impact Entra roles). In ATT&CK terms this is typically Account Manipulation (T1098) for Privilege Escalation and Persistence and often precedes abuse of Valid Accounts (T1078) for lateral movement.  Ôøº

Primary log signals you‚Äôll use
	‚Ä¢	Windows Security Log: 4728 (added to global security group), 4732 (added to local/domain local security group), 4756 (added to universal security group).  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Entra ID (Azure AD) AuditLogs: ActivityDisplayName = ‚ÄúAdd member to group‚Äù (Category=GroupManagement).  Ôøº

L1 ‚Äî Initial triage (5‚Äì10 mins)

Goal: Quickly decide ‚Äúbenign admin/JML or risky change?‚Äù and collect baseline facts.
	1.	Confirm the target group‚Äôs criticality
	‚Ä¢	Is it privileged (e.g., Domain Admins, Administrators on servers, DNSAdmins, Exchange Org Mgmt, Entra ‚ÄúGlobal Administrator/Privileged Role Administrator‚Äù)? If yes, raise priority.
	2.	Extract the who/when/where
	‚Ä¢	From Windows events 4728/4732/4756 capture:
	‚Ä¢	Subject (who performed the add), Member (who was added), Group, Logon ID, Computer.  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	From Entra AuditLogs capture:
	‚Ä¢	InitiatedBy, TargetResources.displayName, Category=GroupManagement, ActivityDisplayName=Add member to group, IPAddress, UserAgent.  Ôøº
	3.	Approval/context check
	‚Ä¢	Look for a change ticket/JML workflow, maintenance window, or CAB change. If found and matches: note evidence and continue to L2 validation (don‚Äôt close yet).
	4.	Time & location sanity
	‚Ä¢	Off-hours? New/unknown source IP/device? Impossible travel around the same time (compare Entra SignInLogs if available).
	5.	Immediate flags for escalate-to-L2
	‚Ä¢	Privileged group, no ticket, unknown admin, automation/service performing unusual change, or multiple adds in burst.

Quick SPL (Windows Security):

| eval CriticalGroup=if(match(Group_Name,"(?i)Domain Admins|Administrators|Enterprise Admins|Schema Admins|DnsAdmins|Exchange Organization Management"),"YES","NO")
| table _time, EventCode, SubjectUserName, SubjectLogonId, MemberName, MemberSid, Group_Name, CriticalGroup, ComputerName
| sort -_time

Quick KQL (Entra ID):

| project TimeGenerated, InitiatedBy = tostring(InitiatedBy.user.displayName),
          ActorUPN = tostring(InitiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName),

          AddedMember=tostring(TargetResources[1].displayName)
| order by TimeGenerated desc

(Fields per Microsoft Learn AuditLogs. Exact columns vary by tenant/connector.)  Ôøº

‚∏ª

L2 ‚Äî Deep investigation (20‚Äì40 mins)

Goal: Prove legitimacy or build an incident narrative with evidence.
	1.	Reconstruct the timeline
	‚Ä¢	¬±2 hours around the change. Look for:
	‚Ä¢	Recent account creation (4720), password reset (4724), user changed (4738), account enabled (4722) near the add (possible attacker setup).  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúGroup changed‚Äù (4735/4755) just before/after the add (sometimes accompanies 4732/4756).  Ôøº
	2.	Correlate the actor‚Äôs session & tool
	‚Ä¢	Windows: tie SubjectLogonId from 4728/4732/4756 to 4624 logon (source IP, logon type). Check for 4648 (logon with explicit creds).
	‚Ä¢	Hunt for admin tools: PowerShell 4104 (Add-ADGroupMember, Set-ADGroup, net localgroup administrators /add, dsmod/dsadd), Sysmon 1 (process creation) on the admin host.
	3.	Cloud-side validation
	‚Ä¢	Entra: match AuditLogs change with SignInLogs of the InitiatedBy user (IP, device compliance, MFA). Look for unfamiliar ISP, TOR/VPN, disabled MFA.
	4.	Blast radius
	‚Ä¢	How many other additions in the same window/actor? Any changes to privileged groups? Any new role assignments in Entra (PIM activations)? (These can also fall under T1098 variants.)  Ôøº
	5.	Business validation
	‚Ä¢	Confirm with app/team owners whether the new access was requested/needed. If yes, capture ticket reference & approver; if no, proceed to L3.

L3 ‚Äî Confirm & respond (60+ mins)

If suspicious or unapproved:
	1.	Contain
	‚Ä¢	Remove the membership from the privileged group (record the exact change).
	‚Ä¢	Disable or suspend the added account (and the actor account if compromised).
	‚Ä¢	If cloud: revoke sessions/refresh tokens for involved identities; force password reset and MFA re-registration.
	2.	Eradicate & harden
	‚Ä¢	On the actor host: collect volatile data, processes, PS transcripts, and hunt for credential theft tools; re-image if needed.
	‚Ä¢	Review/rotate credentials for any impacted service accounts; check other groups the actor touched in the same window.
	3.	Recover
	‚Ä¢	Restore legitimate access via approved workflow; monitor for re-add attempts.
	‚Ä¢	Open a full incident ticket and proceed to RCA.

If legitimate (approved change):
	‚Ä¢	Document ticket/approver, business justification, any policy gaps (e.g., change done outside JML/PIM), and update allowlists (automation accounts, approved admins).

üõ° Recommendations ‚Äî Containment, Remediation, Prevention

Immediate containment (if suspicious)
	‚Ä¢	Remove the membership; disable the involved account(s); revoke sessions (cloud) and force password resets; capture/secure evidence first. (Audit and log steps in ticket; align with your legal/compliance process.)

Hardening & process
	‚Ä¢	Just-In-Time access via Entra PIM / time-bound group membership; require approval + MFA for elevation.
	‚Ä¢	Enforce MFA and strong Conditional Access for all admins; restrict admin tasks to Privileged Access Workstations (PAW).
	‚Ä¢	Centralize group changes via JML workflow (no ad-hoc console changes).
	‚Ä¢	Tiered admin model; separate roles; prohibit daily-driver accounts from holding admin memberships.
	‚Ä¢	Audit & logging: ensure Windows Security Group Management auditing (4728/4732/4756) is enabled, plus PowerShell 4104, Process Creation (Sysmon 1), and Entra AuditLogs/SignInLogs collection.  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Detections:
	‚Ä¢	Privileged group watchlist (alert on any add/remove).
	‚Ä¢	Burst additions by same actor.
	‚Ä¢	Adds followed by immediate admin activity (service control, RDP, DC logon).
	‚Ä¢	Actor from new IP/ASN or from device failing compliance.
	‚Ä¢	Prevent policy gaps:
	‚Ä¢	Disallow standing membership in top-tier groups; prefer PIM/JIT.
	‚Ä¢	Service accounts: document fixed memberships; monitor drift.

‚∏ª

üìé Appendix ‚Äî What to capture before escalating to customer
	‚Ä¢	Exact event(s) (IDs, JSON/XML or full AuditLogs record).  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Actor identity + session details (4624/SignInLogs: IP, logon type, device).
	‚Ä¢	Tooling used (4104 commands, Sysmon process lineage).
	‚Ä¢	Ticket/approval references or explicit absence.
	‚Ä¢	Impact analysis: what the group grants (systems/data), any use of new privileges after the change.
	‚Ä¢	Your recommendation: rollback or accept, plus preventive control(s).
