# üõ°Ô∏è Playbook: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Alert

**Filename:** `ddos-alert.md`  
**Category:** Network / Threat Detection  
**Use Case:** Investigating DDoS alerts raised in Splunk from firewall, WAF, IDS/IPS, or other telemetry.

---

## üéØ Alert Context ‚Äî Why this matters
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack aims to **overwhelm network, server, or application resources** to cause service disruption.  
Impact can include:
- Service outage (critical applications/websites unavailable)  
- Performance degradation (slow responses)  
- Diversionary tactic to mask other intrusions  

**Relevant Detection Sources**
- Firewall logs (high connection rates, SYN floods, UDP floods)  
- WAF logs (HTTP floods, malformed requests)  
- IDS/IPS (Snort/Suricata signatures for DDoS)  
- NetFlow/sFlow telemetry (spikes in PPS/bandwidth)  
- Endpoint/server logs (resource exhaustion, service unavailability)  
- Application logs (HTTP 5xx spikes, error bursts)

## üß≠ Analyst Actions (L1 ‚Üí L2 ‚Üí L3)

## L1 ‚Äî Initial Triage
- ‚úÖ Confirm the **target system** (IP, hostname, service)  
- ‚úÖ Identify **attack vector** (SYN flood, UDP flood, HTTP flood, DNS amplification)  
- ‚úÖ Check time range and scale (spike duration, PPS, bandwidth)  
- ‚úÖ Look for **single vs multiple sources** (is it distributed?)  
- üö© Escalate to L2 if:
  - Multiple source IPs  
  - Traffic spike beyond normal baseline  
  - Critical/public-facing service impacted  

**SPL ‚Äî Detect sudden spike in traffic (firewall logs):**
```
index=firewall action=allowed OR action=blocked
| bin _time span=1m
| stats count as conn by _time dest_ip
| eventstats avg(conn) as baseline, stdev(conn) as deviation by dest_ip
| eval threshold=baseline+(deviation*5)
| where conn > threshold
| table _time dest_ip conn baseline deviation
```

## L2 ‚Äî Deep Investigation & Correlation

1. Firewall / IDS Logs
	‚Ä¢	Look for high-volume connections from single or multiple IPs
	‚Ä¢	Check if packets are incomplete (SYN without ACK)
```spl
index=firewall OR index=ids
| stats count by src_ip dest_ip dest_port protocol
| where count > 1000
```
2. Web Application Firewall (WAF)
	‚Ä¢	HTTP floods: excessive GET/POST requests to same URI
	‚Ä¢	Look for abnormal user-agents or missing headers
```
index=waf
| stats count by src_ip http_user_agent cs_uri_stem
| where count > 500
```
3. NetFlow / Network Telemetry
	‚Ä¢	PPS/throughput anomalies on targeted interface
```
index=netflow
| bin _time span=1m
| stats sum(bytes) as total_bytes sum(packets) as total_packets by _time dest_ip
| eventstats avg(total_packets) as baseline stdev(total_packets) as deviation
| where total_packets > baseline + (deviation*5)
```
4. Endpoint / Server Logs
	‚Ä¢	Resource exhaustion signs: service restarts, kernel TCP backlog full
	‚Ä¢	Windows: Event ID 2022 (server unable to accept connections)
	‚Ä¢	Linux: /var/log/messages showing socket drops

5. Application Logs
	‚Ä¢	HTTP 503/504/500 errors surging
	‚Ä¢	Correlate with WAF spikes
```
index=web sourcetype=iis OR sourcetype=apache
| stats count by sc_status dest_ip
| where sc_status IN ("500","503","504")
```

## L3 ‚Äî Confirm & Respond

If Confirmed DDoS:
	‚Ä¢	üõë Contain
	‚Ä¢	Engage ISP/Upstream provider for rate limiting or blackholing
	‚Ä¢	Enable DDoS protection (Cloudflare, Akamai, Azure/AWS Shield, Arbor)
	‚Ä¢	Apply ACLs/firewall rules to drop attack traffic
	‚Ä¢	üîé Eradicate
	‚Ä¢	Identify malicious IP ranges, block at perimeter
	‚Ä¢	Ensure no secondary intrusion during distraction
	‚Ä¢	üîÅ Recover
	‚Ä¢	Monitor service availability post-mitigation
	‚Ä¢	Tune Splunk thresholds to reduce false positives

If False Positive:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Document unusual but legitimate traffic (marketing campaign, vulnerability scan, load testing)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Add exception rules for expected traffic

	‚Ä¢	T2: Service disruption observed
	‚Ä¢	T3: Mitigation applied (ISP block, WAF, ACLs)
	‚Ä¢	T4: Recovery

3) Root Cause
	‚Ä¢	Category: [SYN flood | UDP flood | HTTP flood | DNS amplification | False alarm]

üõ° Recommendations
	Immediate
	‚Ä¢	Block/blackhole malicious IP ranges
	‚Ä¢	Engage ISP or DDoS mitigation provider
	‚Ä¢	Isolate targeted systems if needed
	Hardening
	‚Ä¢	Deploy DDoS protection services (Cloudflare, Akamai, Arbor, AWS/Azure Shield)
	‚Ä¢	Implement rate limiting (firewall, WAF, reverse proxy)
	‚Ä¢	Geo-blocking for unused regions
	Monitoring
	‚Ä¢	Build anomaly detection on PPS/connection baselines
	‚Ä¢	Detect sudden spikes in error logs (500/503)
	‚Ä¢	Alert on high SYN vs ACK ratios
	Process
	‚Ä¢	Establish escalation to ISP/vendor SOC
	‚Ä¢	Document expected baselines for critical services

üìé Before Escalating to Customer

Include:
	‚Ä¢	Traffic spike details (PPS, bandwidth, duration)
	‚Ä¢	Firewall/WAF/IDS evidence with top talkers (IPs, ports)
	‚Ä¢	Service impact (downtime, latency, 5xx error surge)
	‚Ä¢	TI validation (IPs linked to known botnets, reflection/amplification sources)
	‚Ä¢	Containment steps applied (ACLs, DDoS protection, ISP engagement)
	‚Ä¢	Recommended next steps
