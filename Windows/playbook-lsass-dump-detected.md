# üõ°Ô∏è Playbook: LSASS Dump Detected

**Filename:** `playbook-lsass-dump-detected.md`  
**Category:** Endpoint / Credential Access  
**Use Case:** Investigating alerts triggered when LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) memory is accessed or dumped.

---

## üéØ Alert Context ‚Äî Why this matters
- **LSASS** (lsass.exe) stores Windows authentication secrets (NTLM hashes, Kerberos tickets, plaintext creds in some cases).  
- Attackers dump LSASS memory to steal credentials for **lateral movement, persistence, or domain compromise**.  
- Common tools: `procdump.exe`, `taskmgr.exe`, `comsvcs.dll`, Mimikatz, Cobalt Strike, custom malware.  
- **Risk:** If successful, an attacker can impersonate admins and escalate domain-wide.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Any LSASS dump alert should be treated as **critical severity**.

**Relevant Detection Sources**
- Sysmon Event ID 10 (ProcessAccess) targeting `lsass.exe`  
- Sysmon Event ID 1 (ProcessCreate) with suspicious dump tools  
- EDR/XDR alerts (‚Äúcredential theft‚Äù, ‚Äúmemory dump‚Äù)  
- Windows Security logs (Event ID 4688, 4670)  
- Memory protection logs (Windows Defender, AV)

## üß≠ Analyst Actions (L1 ‚Üí L2 ‚Üí L3)

### L1 ‚Äî Initial Triage
- ‚úÖ Review alert details: host, user, process, timestamp.  
- ‚úÖ Confirm which process tried to access LSASS:
  - Legitimate (AV/EDR agent, backup software)?  
  - Suspicious (Mimikatz, procdump, custom binary)?  
- ‚úÖ Check if the process is **signed, from valid path**.  
- üö© Escalate to L2 if:
  - Process is unsigned, suspicious path (AppData, Temp).  
  - Known dumping tools used.  
  - Elevated or SYSTEM account involved.  

**SPL ‚Äî Detect processes accessing LSASS**
```spl
index=sysmon EventCode=10 TargetImage="*lsass.exe"
| table _time host User SourceImage SourceProcessId TargetImage GrantedAccess CallTrace
| sort 0 _time


‚∏ª

L2 ‚Äî Deep Investigation

1. Process Lineage
	‚Ä¢	Trace parent and child processes for the dumping tool.

index=sysmon EventCode=1 host=<HOST> ProcessId=<SourceProcessId>
| table _time Image CommandLine ParentImage ParentCommandLine User

2. Binary Validation
	‚Ä¢	Extract file hash and check with VirusTotal / internal TI.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm digital signature status.

index=sysmon EventCode=1 Image="<SourceImage>"
| stats values(SHA256) as hash values(Company) as vendor values(Signed) as signed by Image

3. Logon Context
	‚Ä¢	Correlate with logon events (4624/4672) to see which account was active.

index=wineventlog (EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4672) host=<HOST>
| search LogonId=<LogonId_from_Sysmon>
| table _time TargetUserName IpAddress LogonType AuthenticationPackageName

4. Other Credential Access Attempts
	‚Ä¢	Check for registry hive access (SAM, SYSTEM, SECURITY).
	‚Ä¢	Sysmon Event ID 11 (file creation of suspicious dump files, e.g., .dmp).

index=sysmon EventCode=11 host=<HOST>
| search TargetFilename="*.dmp"
| table _time host TargetFilename Image User

5. Network Activity
	‚Ä¢	Did the dumping tool beacon out?

index=sysmon EventCode=3 ProcessId=<SourceProcessId>
| table _time dest_ip dest_port ProcessName


‚∏ª

L2 ‚Äî Lateral Movement Investigation

Because LSASS dumps often precede lateral spread, check for:

A) Abnormal Logons After Dump
	‚Ä¢	Successful logons (4624) from dumped account creds.

index=wineventlog EventCode=4624 host!=<ORIGINAL_HOST>
| search AccountName=<SuspectedAccount>
| table _time host AccountName LogonType IpAddress AuthenticationPackageName

B) Remote Execution Tools
	‚Ä¢	psexec.exe, wmic.exe, schtasks.exe, RDP (3389), SMB (445).

index=sysmon EventCode=1 host=<ORIGINAL_HOST>
| search Image IN ("*psexec.exe","*wmic.exe","*schtasks.exe","*mstsc.exe")
| table _time host User Image CommandLine ParentImage

C) Kerberos/NTLM Abuse
	‚Ä¢	Unusual 4769 (Kerberos tickets) or 4624 LogonType=3 with NTLM.

‚∏ª

L3 ‚Äî Confirm & Respond

If Malicious (True Positive):
	‚Ä¢	üõë Contain
	‚Ä¢	Isolate the host.
	‚Ä¢	Suspend/kill the dumping process.
	‚Ä¢	üîé Eradicate
	‚Ä¢	Collect memory/image for forensic analysis.
	‚Ä¢	Remove persistence.
	‚Ä¢	üîÅ Recover
	‚Ä¢	Reset credentials for accounts that logged into the host.
	‚Ä¢	Reimage host if SYSTEM compromise confirmed.

If Benign (False Positive):
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Some security products (AV/EDR) legitimately query LSASS.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Verify vendor documentation.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Add to allowlist if confirmed benign.

	‚Ä¢	Hardening
	‚Ä¢	Enable LSASS protection (RunAsPPL).
	‚Ä¢	Deploy Windows Defender Credential Guard.
	‚Ä¢	Restrict access to lsass.exe to only SYSTEM and protected processes.

	‚Ä¢	Detect known dump tool names (procdump.exe, lsass.dmp).
	‚Ä¢	Alert on abnormal remote logons after LSASS dump attempts.
